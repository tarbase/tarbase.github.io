# tarbase.com website

This is the code for the [Tarbase website](https://www.tarbase.com).

## Quick start

1. Use Git to clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:tarbase/tarbase.github.io.git`
2. Just the first time: `bundle install`
3. To build the site and serve it: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
4. To test: `http://localhost:4000`

## Docker quick start

As an alternative to installing Ruby and Jekyll, if you're a user of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker
Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), you can run a Docker image of gruntwork-io that has all the dependencies
already setup for you.

On Linux or MacOS (running Docker for Mac):

1. Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:tarbase/tarbase.github.io.git`
2. Run `docker-compose up`
3. Go to `http://localhost:4000` to test
4. When finished press `Ctrl-C` then `docker-compose down` to teardown.
